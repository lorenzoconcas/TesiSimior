A scoring system is in place in Italy's intensive care units (ICUs) used to assess the risk of mortality in patients with severe sepsis. There is currently no standardized computer system for calculating this score, consequently the Duilio Casula Hospital Polyclinic in collaboration with the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Cagliari have collaborated to create the SIMIOR project. To calculate this score and extrapolate statistics, however, data from medical records is required, which is entered manually.

This thesis analyzes the implementation of the necessary automatisms to accelerate the process of entering the medical reports into the system, the structure of the medical reports and the changes implemented to the SIMIOR system.
